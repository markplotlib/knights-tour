# algebraic chess notation (bottom left corner is square a1,
# bottom right is h1 for an 8x8 and top right is h8 for an 8x8 board).

# BRUTE FORCE
# Write an algorithm (in Python) that loops through all possible permutations of
# the squares of an r x c chess board, checking each one to see if it is a
# Hamiltonian path or not. Print out every millionth path, as you go,
# to show progress. Your output has to look substantially similar to mine,
# as shown here for the start of running it for a 4x4 board:
